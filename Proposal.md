**Project Description:**
Develop a personal portfolio that amalgamates my skills as a UX Designer, Front-End Developer, and Graphic Designer. This digital space will provide an overview of my works, capabilities, and the range of design and development projects I have worked on.

1. **Purpose of the Website:**

The primary purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects, serving as a digital resume and platform for potential employers or clients to understand my work and reach out for collaborations or opportunities.

2. **Inspiration for the Project:**

As a designer, I always wanted to design and develop my own portfolio, and although I had the design skills, I lacked front-end knowledge till now. This project will be quite beneficial for me to apply for jobs and also having a place to keep all my work together for the users to view.

3. **Intended Audience:**

1. Potential employers or recruiters in UX Design, Front-End Development, and Graphic Design sectors
2. Fellow designers and developers seeking inspiration or collaboration
3. Anyone interested in design and development services

**JavaScript's Unknown Territories:**
