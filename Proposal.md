**Project Description:**
Developing a personal portfolio that amalgamates my skills as a UX Designer, Front-End Developer, and Graphic Designer. This digital space will provide an overview of my works, capabilities, and the range of design and development projects I have worked on.

1. **Purpose of the Website:**

  The primary purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects, serving as a digital resume and platform for potential employers or clients to understand my work and reach out for collaborations or opportunities.

2. **Inspiration for the Project:**

As a designer, I always wanted to design and develop my own portfolio, and although I had design skills, I lacked front-end knowledge until now. This project will be quite beneficial for me to apply for jobs and also have a place to keep all my work together for the users to view.

3. **Intended Audience:**

1. Potential employers or recruiters in UX Design, Front-End Development, and Graphic Design sectors
2. Fellow designers and developers seeking inspiration or collaboration
3. Anyone interested in design and development services

**Wireframes link:** https://www.figma.com/file/tMWrAzDRMl7XoCFULbEsNS/Portfolio-Wireframes?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=wGDACvF0El6SYPhs-1  (I created two low fidelity wireframes of Home and Work Webpages; the other navigation options will scroll down in the main page itself.)

**JavaScript Usage:**

1. Toggle between light and dark themes
2. Create a Parallax Effect
3. Dynamic Filtering in the Work section to easily filter my work according to the user's needs. (Based on the type of work: UX, Front-End, Graphic Design; Date posted, etc)

**JavaScript's Unknown Territories:**

1. Add transitions using JS libraries. I plan to integrate the Three.js library to bring in some 3D elements and animations, adding depth and engagement to the portfolio.
2. Other APIs that I am thinking of using are AOS, Anime.js, and Isotope, Particle.js.
3. Implement an interactive 3D header

**Content or Information Sources:**

1. Personal projects and case studies (P.S.: Each Case Study will have its own unique design).
2. Design graphics and assets created during my career

**Responsive Design Strategy:**

1. Utilizing CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout management
2. Testing on various devices and screen resolutions to ensure consistent display and interaction
3. Incorporating media queries to adjust content based on device capabilities (in both CSS and JS).

**Prototyping/proof of concept:**

  a. Draft the basic layout and structure
  b. Create low-fidelity mockups for all pages
  c. Identify key interactive elements

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**

  a. Develop a functional site with basic interactivity
  b. Include at least 3 showcased projects
  c. Implement primary navigation and contact information along with a working form to be able to reach out for collaborations, etc.

**Stretch Goals:**

  a. Using a CMS for efficiently adding my portfolio work
  b. Adding Client testimonials and feedback (Will request a few testimonials from the clients I worked with before).
